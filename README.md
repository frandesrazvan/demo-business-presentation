## Deployment: GitHub Pages

To deploy this site on GitHub Pages:

1. Push your project to a GitHub repository.
2. (Recommended) Ensure a `.nojekyll` file exists in the root to disable Jekyll processing.
3. Go to your repository on GitHub > Settings > Pages.
4. Under "Source", select the branch (usually `main`) and the root (`/`) folder.
5. Save. Your site will be published at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

If you use absolute asset paths, update them to be relative or use the correct base path for GitHub Pages.
